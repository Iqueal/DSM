# Asignment 30-jan-2023 Python

1. Write a program to accept percentage from the user and display the grade according to the following criteria:

   | **Marks**       |     | **Grade** |
   | --------------- | --- | :-------: |
   | > 90            |     |     A     |
   | > 80 and <= 90  |     |     B     |
   | >= 60 and <= 80 |     |     C     |
   | Below 60        |     |     D     |

   Ans: We can do it with multiple ways, here is an example using **if elif**:

   ```py
   percentage = int(input("Enter your percentage: "))
   if percentage < 60: print("D")
   elif (percentage >= 60 and percentage <= 80) : print("C")
   elif (percentage > 80 and percentage <= 90) : print("B")
   elif (percentage > 90) : print("A")
   ```

2. Write a program to accept the cost price of a bike and display the road tax to be paid according to the following criteria:

   | **Tax** |     | **Cost Price (in Rs)** |
   | :-----: | --- | ---------------------- |
   |   15%   |     | >100000                |
   |   10%   |     | >50000 and <=100000    |
   |   5%    |     | <=50000                |

   Ans:

   ```py
   costPrice = int(input("Enter cost price: "))
   if costPrice <= 50000:
    print("Tax: ", (5/100) * costPrice)
   elif (costPrice > 50000 and costPrice <= 100000):
    print("Tax: ", (10/100) * costPrice)
   else:
    print("Tax: ", (15/100) * costPrice)
   ```

3. Accept any city from the user and display monuments of that city:

   | **City** |     | **Monument** |
   | :------: | --- | ------------ |
   |  Delhi   |     | Redfort      |
   |   Agra   |     | Taj Mahal    |
   |  Jaipur  |     | Jal Mahal    |

   Ans:

   ```py
   city = input("Enter City: ").title()

   dict = {
   "Delhi": "Red Fort",
   "Agra": "Taj Mahal",
   "Jaipur": "Jal Mahal"
   }

   print(city + ":", dict[city] if city in dict else "Error 404", city)
   ```

4. Check how many times a given number can be divided by 3 before it is less than or equal to 10.

   Ans:

   ```py
   num = int(input("Enter the number: "))
   value = num
   count = 0

   while value >= 10:
      value /= 3
      count += 1

   print(str(count) + " times")

   if count print(num, ("รท3 " * count) + "= " + str(value)[:4])
   ```

5. why and When to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example.

   Ans: The while loop can be used to perform some task in a repeated manner, we can use either of the for or while loops in such conditions but cometimes it becomes easier to use the while loop insted of the for loop because of its small syntax. An example of which is in `Q4 above`, in which we have a condition that if is true will make the block of code run else will move out of the code block.

   The condition is that if the value is greater or equal to 10, if this is true the loop is going to execute the block of code otherwise if the contion is false the code block will not be executed and will come out of the loop.

   We need to provide some logic which will make the condition false at a certain point otherwise the loop will be infinite.

6. Use nested while loop to print three different pattern.

   Ans:

   ```py
   # ========================#
   #! Pattern-1 :

   i = 7

   while i > 1:
   i -= 1
   j = i
   while j > (i - 1):
      j -= 1
      print("โข " * j)


   # ========================#
   #! Pattern-2 :

   i = 8
   while i>1:
   i -= 1
   j = 10;
   while j>0:
      j -= 1
      if ((j > 2) and (j < 7) and (i!=4)):
         print(" ", end="")
         continue
      print("@", end="")
   print("")


   # ========================#
   #! Pattern-3 :

   i = 5
   j = 5

   while i > 0:
      i -= 1
      while j > 0:
         j -= 1
         print("+"*(i*j), end="")
      print("")
   ```

7. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.

   Ans:

   ```py
   i = 10

   while i>0:
      print(i)
      i -= 1
   ```

8. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.

   Ans:

   ```py
   i = 0

   while i<10:
      print(10-i)
      i += 1
   ```
