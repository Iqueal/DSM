1. Who developed Python Programming Language?

   Ans: **Guido van Rossum**

<hr>

2. Which type of Programming does Python support?

   Ans: Python supports **multi-paradim programing** i,e functional as well as Object orientied programing.

<hr>

3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?

   Ans: **Yes**, identifiers like variable names etc are case sensitive. Means we can't use Name instead of name.

<hr>

4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?

   Ans: **.py** is the correct extention for python files but we can use jupyter lab and jupyter notebooks to write python code whose extenstion will be **.ipynb** meaning interactive python notebooks.

<hr>

5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?

   Ans: Python is an interpreted programing language hence python code is **interpreted**.

<hr>

6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?

   Ans: Python blocks are defined by the **indentation**. We can use indentation to define the blocks for 'if', 'for', 'while', 'def' etc.

<hr>

7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?

   Ans: It is hash **#**.

<hr>

8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?

   Ans: We can use sys_version identifier from "wsgiref.simple_server" which returns the currently used python version as string.

   ```py
   from wsgiref.simple_server import sys_version
   sys_version
   ```

<hr>

9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called:

   Ans: **Lambda functions** are the functions with no name hence anynamyous.

<hr>

10. What does pip stand for python?

    Ans: PIP is the package installer for python stands for **Prefered Installer Program**.

<hr>

11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?

    Ans: Python has a lot of built-in functions:

    - type()
    - str()
    - len()
    - count()
    - int()
    - insert()
    - append()
    - reverse()
    - sort()
    - casefold()

<hr>

12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?

    Ans: It does'nt seem to me that there is any limit as I tried till 1000+ characters.

<hr>

13. What are the benefits of using Python?

    Ans:

    - Python is **simple**.
    - It is **easy**.
    - Its **syntax is smaller** most of the times.
    - It is **Object oriented** as well as **functional** giving us the flexibility of writing any type of program.
    - So we are **not bound to use OOP** while being in python.
    - It can be used for almost anything:
      - Data Science
      - Machine Learning
      - App Development
    - It has amazing frameworks:
      - Django
      - FastAPI
      - Flask (micro-framework)
    - It has lots of **built-in** as well as **external libraries**.
    - It has a **huge community** support.

<hr>

14. How is memory managed in Python?

    Ans: Memory managaement in python is done using **heap** under the hood.

<hr>

15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?

    Ans:

    - Go to the official website
    - Download the preffered version.
    - Install like any other software.
    - Chack the option add to path variable during installation steps.
    - If you forgot to do that then you can manually navigate to the environment variables and add python to paths variable.

<hr>

16. Is indentation required in python?

    Ans: Oh yes, that's **cumpulsory**. I usually say that python teaches us to write clean code.
